# google\_compute\_zone

Represents a Zone resource.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_compute_zone" "default" {
  TODO: Add fields
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:



- - -

* `name` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the resource.
* `project` (Optional) The project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
* `deprecated` -
  The deprecation status associated with this machine type.
  Structure is documented below.
* `description` -
  An optional textual description of the resource.
* `id` -
  The unique identifier for the resource.
* `region` -
  A reference to Region resource
* `status` -
  The status of the zone.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


The `deprecated` block contains:
* `deleted` -
  An optional RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the state of this
resource is intended to change to DELETED. This is only
informational and the status will not change unless the client
explicitly changes it.
* `deprecated` -
  An optional RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the state of this
resource is intended to change to DEPRECATED. This is only
informational and the status will not change unless the client
explicitly changes it.
* `obsolete` -
  An optional RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the state of this
resource is intended to change to OBSOLETE. This is only
informational and the status will not change unless the client
explicitly changes it.
* `replacement` -
  The URL of the suggested replacement for a deprecated resource.
The suggested replacement resource must be the same kind of
resource as the deprecated resource.
* `state` -
  The deprecation state of this resource. This can be DEPRECATED,
OBSOLETE, or DELETED. Operations which create a new resource
using a DEPRECATED resource will return successfully, but with a
warning indicating the deprecated resource and recommending its
replacement. Operations which use OBSOLETE or DELETED resources
will be rejected and result in an error.
